# Weekly Team Challenge Platform - Development Update

## ✅ Tasks Completed:

1. **Added is_active field to User model**
   - Added the field to the User model's fillable properties
   - Created migration for adding is_active column with default value of true
   - Implemented checkbox in profile settings

2. **Updated TeamAssignmentController to filter by active users**
   - Changed `User::all()` to `User::where('is_active', true)->get()`
   - Teams are now only generated for active users

3. **Added deadline enforcement to match submissions**
   - Added check in `MatchController@submitSolution` to prevent submissions after deadline
   - Returns friendly error message when deadline is passed

4. **Standardized status badges across the application**
   - Updated `MatchStatus` component to use consistent color mappings:
     - created: gray
     - in_progress: amber
     - submitted: green
     - closed: blue
   - Fixed the status display in match index view

5. **Improved dashboard CTAs for solver teams**
   - Added clear Start and Submit buttons based on match status
   - Fixed team membership checking in blade templates

6. **Added comprehensive tests**
   - Created `UserActiveStatusTest.php` with three test cases:
     - Team generation only includes active users
     - User can toggle is_active setting in profile
     - is_active is false when checkbox is not checked
   - Added a test command `test:active-users` for diagnostics

## 🚫 Known Limitations:

1. Old code still exists in some views that need to be updated to use the match-status component
2. Some CSS classes might reference old status names (pending vs created)

## 📝 Next Steps:

1. Complete status badge standardization across all views
2. Add more user feedback for deadline enforcement
3. Create notification system for weekly transitions
4. Update README with new features
5. Consider implementing timezone-aware notifications for weekly transitions

## 🛠️ Testing Instructions:

1. Run feature tests: `php artisan test tests/Feature/UserActiveStatusTest.php`
2. Test active user filtering: `php artisan test:active-users`
3. Manually test profile settings page to verify is_active checkbox works
4. Try submitting a solution after deadline to verify enforcement
5. Test scheduler: `php artisan schedule:list` to verify timezone settings

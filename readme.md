# Weekly Mini-Game Platform

A Laravel 12 + Livewire application for student team challenges.  
Built as part of the *Grundlagen Programmieren â€“ Datenbank Modell* assignment.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept

- Every **week** (`week_label`) students are assigned randomly to **teams** (4 members each).
- Each team **creates one challenge** and **solves another teamâ€™s challenge** within **20 minutes**.
- **Submissions** (e.g. link, file URL) are uploaded by the solver team.
- Afterwards, all **other users** can **vote (1â€“5)** and leave a comment.
- **Scoring rule**: creator and solver teams both receive the same points based on votes.

## ðŸ—„ Database Schema (5 Models incl. `User`)

- **users** â€“ authentication (Breeze + Livewire).
- **teams** â€“ groups of 4 per `week_label`.
- **participants** â€“ link table (User â†” Team), treated as model (`role`, timestamps).
- **matches** â€“ one challenge per creator/solver team pair; tracks challenge text, submission, status.
- **votes** â€“ 1 vote per user per match (excluding creator/solver teams).
